# UI Interview Demo

This repo represents my quick take on the UI craft demo design requirements.
The work was completed with React and custom CSS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


#### Project Status
+ Base form created with HTML elements
+ Created FieldBuilder React functional component with initial useState and useEffect hooks
+ Applied custom css to match UI design concept. Included some unique takes on the design, including making use
of the new Quickbase color scheme
+ Integrated given MockService.js file with fetch POST request
+ Applied flexbox containers to allow the form to be moderately responsive to changes in screen size
+ Made use of third party library to display toast messages as feedback for user submission and clearing of form
